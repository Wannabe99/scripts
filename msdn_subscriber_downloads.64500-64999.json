For more information, see Release Management for TFS 2015 and VS Team Services (<a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/vs/alm/Release/overview\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/vs/alm/Release/overview</a>). \n<br/><br/>\nIf you are considering starting with Release Management, you should use the new web-based version. If you are already using the server and client version described in this topic, you should be aware that no new features will be added to this version. We encourage you to move to new web-based version as soon as possible.\n<br/>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Release Management for Visual Studio 2015 supports you to configure, approve and deploy your applications for any environment. Create automated deployment orchestrations for each environment no matter how complex the configuration. Delivering your software more frequently and easily to an environment allows your testers to get to work validating your system and keeps your stakeholders involved in giving feedback. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nRelease Management for Visual Studio 2015 requires Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 or Test Professional 2015. For licensing requirements refer to <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13350\">Visual Studio and MSDN Licensing White Paper</a>. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Note</b>:\nTo enable the release management capabilities, you must also install the Release Management Server for Team Foundation Server 2015. To model release processes and enable graphical views of release status, you must have the Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2015. For agent-based releases, on every target machine to which you want to publish deployments, you must install Microsoft Deployment Agent 2015. For vNext Releases, you don\u2019t need to install Microsoft Deployment Agent on the target machine.\n<br/>\n<br/><a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2015-rtm-vs\">VS Release Notes</a><br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/tfs2015-rtm-vs\">TFS Release Notes</a><br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3077455\">TFS Known Issues</a><br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/productinfo/vs2015-sysrequirements-vs\">System Requirements</a><br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/productinfo/vs2015-compatibility-vs\">Compatibility</a>",
