To model release processes and enable graphical views of release status, you must have the Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2015.

To model release processes and enable graphical views of release status, you must have the Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2015.

Create automated deployment orchestrations for each environment no matter how complex the configuration. Delivering your software more frequently and easily to an environment allows your testers to get to work validating your system and keeps your stakeholders involved in giving feedback. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nRelease Management for Visual Studio 2015 RC requires Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 RC or Test Professional 2015 RC. For licensing requirements refer to <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13350\">Visual Studio and MSDN Licensing White Paper</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Note</b>:\r\nTo enable the release management capabilities, you must also install the Release Management Server for Team Foundation Server 2015 RC. To model release processes and enable graphical views of release status, you must have the Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2015. For agent-based releases, on every target machine to which you want to publish deployments, you must install Microsoft Deployment Agent 2013.
